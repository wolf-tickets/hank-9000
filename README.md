# hank-9000

Hank 9000 is a (minimally) artificially intelligent cat companion robot. It is named after Hank, an exceptionally needy housecat.

Plans for the future include algorithmic pathfinding, collision avoidance, integrated webcam and lcd screen, sound device for playing bird sounds, treat dispenser, and some form of remote control, possibly via web application.

At present, it's pretty good at navigating around the house without getting stuck or crashing into things - and that's about it. Hank feelings towards it could be described as "suspicious".

Current hardware includes an Arduino Uno, two ultrasonic distance sensors, and two indepdendent electric motors with a separate power supply and controller. These are mounted on a hand-cut plywood chassis - the original plastic chassis was sat upon by a guest and destroyed.

Adding a Raspberry Pi to the platform to handle more complex processing tasks is currently under consideration.
